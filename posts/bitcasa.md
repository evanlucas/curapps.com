Bitcasa is a newer storage provider that offers the first 10 GB free.  With Bitcasa, there is only one paid tier which offers unlimited storage for $69/year

Bitcasa works great for just random storage for us.  They provide a couple of different ways to store your files including:

- Mirroring
- Infinite Drive (Just like an external hard drive)

I've found that it can be a great way to store pictures, especially now that they have introduced their iOS application.  You can have it automatically upload your photos from your device.

Overall, I just simply like what they have to offer and how they actually offer it. Try it out.  10GB of free storage isn't too bad of a deal.
